hello-world
===========
My name is Phila Madondo, I am Electronic Engineer by profession. I feel that I have terribly rusted over the years by having moved to a General Management area in my career. I am doing this Coursera Data Science Specialization as a way to revive my technical career. I am really excited about this journey and I am confident tha I am doing the right thing for myself - eventually!!!
